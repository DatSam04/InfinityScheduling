                We know how it feels to wonder what a website is doing behind the scenes. That’s why we keep it simple:
                <strong>No personal data, no logins, no cookies, no trackers.</strong>
            </p>

            <h4>No Personal Data</h4>  <!-- ===== No Personal Data ===== -->
